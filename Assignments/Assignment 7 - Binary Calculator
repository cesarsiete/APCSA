 * For this lab, you will enter two numbers in base ten and translate them to binary. You will then add the numbers in binary and print out the result. 
 * All numbers entered will be between 0 and 255, inclusive, and binary output is limited to 8 bits.  
 * This means that the sum of the two added numbers will also be limited to 8 bits.  
 * If the sum of the two numbers is more than 8 bits, please print the first 8 digits of the sum and the message "Error: overflow". 
 * Your program should represent binary numbers using integer arrays, with the ones digit (2^0) stored at index 0, the twos digit (2^1) stored at index 1,  
 * all the way up to the 2^7 digit stored at index 7. 
 * Your program should include the following methods: 
 * int[] convertToBinary(int b)Translates the parameter to a binary value and returns it stored as an array of ints. 
 * void printBin(int b[])Outputs the binary number stored in the array on one line. Please note, there should be exactly one space between each output 0 or 1. 
 * int[] addBin(int a[], int b[])Adds the two binary numbers stored in the arrays, and returns the sum in a new array of ints. 
 *  
 * Sample Run 1: 
 * Enter a base ten number between 0 and 255, inclusive. 
 * 56 
 * Enter a base ten number between 0 and 255, inclusive. 
 * 2 
 *  
 * First binary number: 
 * 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 
 *  
 * Second binary number: 
 * 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 
 *  
 * Added: 
 * 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 
 *  
 * Sample Run 2: 
 * Enter a base ten number between 0 and 255, inclusive. 
 * 200 
 * Enter a base ten number between 0 and 255, inclusive. 
 * 150 
 *  
 * First binary number: 
 * 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 
 *  
 * Second binary number: 
 * 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 
 *  
 * Added: 
 * Error: overflow 
 * 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0
