/*
 * Write a program that will simulate a change machine found at cash registers. Input the amount due and amount paid from the keyboard.
   Tell the user how much change is owed and number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies in change a customer would receive.
   Pay special attention to roundoff error. Your program should use division and modular division. No if’≥ or loops may be used. You may assume all change will be a 
   positive number with no more than two decimal places. If more than $1.00 is owed, the full value should be included in the number of quarters returned. For example, 
   $2.50 should be returned as 10 quarters.
   Hint: Modular division is a great way to find the remainder of a division. Think about how you can use this to calculate the change that is left over after some coins are 
   given.
   Sample Run:
     Please Enter the Cost of the Item: 
     4.57 
     Please Enter the Amount Paid: 
     5.00 
     Change Owed: 0.43 
     Quarters: 1
     Dimes: 1
     Nickels: 1 
     Pennies: 3
