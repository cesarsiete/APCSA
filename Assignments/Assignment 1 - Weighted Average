/*
 * Assignment One- Weighted Average
 *For this assignment, write a program that will input a set of grades and compute a weighted average.
  The program should input 2 test scores (as ints), 3 quiz scores (also as ints) and a homework average (as a double).
  The program should then output the test average, quiz average and final grade (as doubles).
  The final grade should be a weighted average. Count the test average as 50% of the final grade, the quiz average as 30% of the final grade and the homework average as 20% of the final grade.
  Sample Run:
  Please enter your test grades.
  Test 1: 89
  Test 2: 86

  Please enter your quiz grades.
  Quiz 1: 84
  Quiz 2: 84
  Quiz 3: 83

  Please enter your homework average.
  Homework: 90.12

  Test Average: 87.5
  Quiz Average: 83.66666666666667
  Final Grade: 86.874
