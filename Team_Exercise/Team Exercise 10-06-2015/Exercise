 * Write a program that reads three numbers and prints ҩncreasingӠif they are in increasing order, ҤecreasingӠif they are in decreasing order, and ҮeitherӠotherwise. 
 * Here, ҩncreasingӠmeans ҳtrictly increasingӬ with each value larger than its predecessor. The sequence 3 4 4 would not be considered increasing.
